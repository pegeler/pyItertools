pyItertools
===========

**Work in progress**

Recreating the Python *itertools* and *more-itertools* APIs for R.

Provides functions similar to those found in the
[itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) standard library
package and the third-party
[more-itertools](https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
package. Also contains functions to emulate several Python builtins.
[Operators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html) are also included
to facilitate piping. Combinators might also be added.
